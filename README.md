# The Hangman Game
---
## Overview
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where you have to guess the letters present in the word one by one. If you exceed the number of wrong guesses allowed, the game is over. This project implements Hangman game in two versions using Java.

- **Hangman.java**:
This program uses basic for/while loops and conditional statements, all within the main method to run the game.

- **Hangman2.java**:
This is a more modular approach, using multiple methods to break down the logic, improving code readablity and maintainability.

## Requirements:
- Java 17 or higher

- A `words.txt` file containing the words to be used in game
